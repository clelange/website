#### Who can join?

Everyone is welcome to join! Designers, makers, coders, every point of view counts!

#### But I'm really a complete beginner. Can I still come?

Of course! The greater the diversity of backgrounds and skills,
the more awesome the outcome!

#### How much does it cost?

Nothing. It is totally free.

#### What is civic tech?

It is technology that enables citizen engagement. It means citizens building infrastructure for their city, instead of governments building it. That's what
[The Things Network](https://thethingsnetwork.org) communities are doing with LoRaWAN in
multiple cities of the world, among them, here in Zurich we are part of a community that has already deployed a LoRaWAN network in the city.

#### What is LoRaWAN?

It's a wireless technology, much like your regular WiFi, but it's ideal for IoT and battery
powered sensors because it has a huge range.

Head over to [The Things Network](https://thethingsnetwork.org) website, and check out
the *LEARN* section and the forum.
